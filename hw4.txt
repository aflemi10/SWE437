Describe the flaw in terms of the RIPR model.
Be as precise, specific, and concise as you can.
For full credit, you must use the terminology in the book.
2a.
  The flaw in this test method is that it only checks the
  first prime number of a list of prime numbers for correctness.
  This means that the rest of the list could be filled with
  non-primes and the test would not reveal this.
  R- The fault can be reached any time computePrimes() is called
     on all numbers greater than 1.
  I- The execution of this fault will lead to a list of potentially
     non prime numbers.
  P- The infected state will propagate to whatever code block that
     needs a list of n prime numbers and will give the executing code
     block a list of non prime numbers.
  R- This test will not reveal the primality of rest of the integers
     in the list.


Rewrite the test method to correct the flaw.
2b.
@Test
public void testComputePrimes()
{
   p.computePrimes(5); // Compute the first 5 prime numbers
   String test = "[2,3,5,7,11]"
   assertTrue("computePrimes failed", p.getFirstPrime().toString().equals(test));
}
